# Secret Guesser

A fun and engaging web application that asks you a series of seemingly innocent questions, then makes a wildly accurate (or hilariously wrong) guess about your deepest, most hidden secret.

## Features

- **Progressive Question Flow**: Starts with casual questions and gradually gets more personal
- **AI-Powered Secret Guessing**: Analyzes your answers to generate a personalized secret guess
- **Accuracy Rating**: Shows how confident the AI is about its guess
- **Share Your Results**: Easily share your revealed secret on social media
- **Modern UI**: Beautiful, responsive design with dark/light theme support

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **Backend**: Supabase for data storage and authentication
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

## How It Works

The Secret Guesser uses a combination of psychological profiling techniques and pattern matching to analyze your responses. While it may seem like magic, it's actually using a clever algorithm that:

1. Categorizes questions by depth (casual, personal, deep)
2. Assigns weights to different answer patterns
3. Uses a probability model to select the most likely secret
4. Adds a touch of randomness to keep things interesting
